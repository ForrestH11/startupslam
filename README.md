What
----
Startup Slam is a one day event filled with workshops meant to give you a glimpse into the world of active startups, the real-world challenges they face, and the technologies they use to conquer them. Each session will focus on a specific, practical skill or strategy to help prepare you for the startup world.


Why
----
The technical skills you learn in school are useful, but figuring out when and how to apply them is something else entirely. We've brought together industry experts to tlak about their experiences doing exactly that, in hopes of better preparing you for life in the startup world.
