=============

This is a 4-stage tutorial on building a startup website in 20 minutes.


Requirements
------------

To follow along you will need to do the following:

- Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads)


Running the Code
----------------

Node uses a package manager called [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/) which you already have if
you've installed Node. To install the required packages for these tutorials, simply type
`npm install` from within one of the four tutorial directories. This will download all the
packages needed and make them available to use.

Note that NPM looks at a file called `package.json` in the current directory to know which
packages are needed.


Deploying to Heroku
-------------------

To get this app on Heroku you can follow Step 4 from
[Node + Heroku Tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#deploy-the-app)
